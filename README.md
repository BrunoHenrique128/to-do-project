# ✅React Todo

Aplicação de lista de tarefas desenvolvida com React, que permite criar, concluir e deletar tarefas com persistência de dados via API local.

# ✨Funcionalidades

Adicionar tarefas com título e duração estimada

Marcar tarefas como concluídas (e desmarcar)

Deletar tarefas

Persistência de dados via json-server (API REST local)

Estado de carregamento enquanto os dados são buscados

# 🛠️Tecnologias

React

React Icons - ícones de ação (concluir e deletar)

json-server - API REST simulada para persistência local

# 🚀Como Rodar o Projeto

Pré-requisitos

Node.js instalado

npm ou yarn

# Instalação

Clone o repositório

git clone https://github.com/BrunoHenrique128/seu-repositorio.git

Entre na pasta do projeto

cd react-todo

Instale as dependências

npm install

Rodando a aplicação

O projeto precisa de dois terminais rodando ao mesmo tempo: um para o json-server e outro para o React.

# Terminal 1 — inicia a API local na porta 3000

npx json-server --watch db.json --port 3000

# Terminal 2 — inicia a aplicação React

npm start

Acesse no navegador: http://localhost:3001

Atenção: o json-server precisa estar rodando para que as tarefas sejam carregadas e salvas corretamente.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
